        <p>
            The Teyvat Collective Network, also known as the TCN, is a network of high-quality
            Genshin Impact Discord servers dedicated to fostering Mains-style fan communities. We
            place an emphasis on collaborative community-building, servers offering help and
            resources to each other, and maintaining healthy and safe communities for Genshin Impact
            fans to find a home in on Discord.
        </p>

        <p>
            The TCN does not enforce any particular structure on its member servers. TCN servers are
            not required to change their server setup, follow a template, enforce particular rules,
            or give any permissions to TCN observers. Our only requirements are to display a list of
            TCN partner servers, cross-post event promotions from partner servers, and maintain a
            healthy community that follows its rules.
        </p>
        <p>The TCN is divided into three components:</p>
        <div class="panel">
            <ITitle e="h3" icon="business" text="Individual Servers" />
            <p>
                These are the individual servers of the TCN, each a mains server dedicated to a
                specific character.

            <p>
                This is the official public server for the TCN, where you can contact observers and
                other server staff and ask questions or give feedback about the TCN.

            <p>
                This is the headquarters server for the TCN. It is private to the TCN council, which
                consists of each server's owner and up to one other trusted member. This server
                facilitates communication and coordination of servers.

            <ITitle e="h3" icon="info" text="Information" />
            <p>
                As a member server of the TCN, you get access to information on members, ongoing
                issues, as well as informative resources like server setup and tools and on-demand
                help for the technical aspects and community and staff management.

            <p>
                TCN servers have quick and easy access to communication with each other. In addition
                to being able to more quickly resolve any issues and form strong relationships with
                many other prominent servers, you have the unique opportunity to more easily start
                collaborations for things like events, which you can also promote through the TCN's
                event announcement feed.

            <p>
                When you join the TCN, you automatically become a TCN partner of all TCN servers and
                will have your server listed on the partner list in all of them. Additionally, you
                will be able to get tips on how to improve your server environment and grow a
                strong, healthy community.

            <p>
                As a TCN server, besides direct connections with other server owners, you will also
                have access to networking with admins in HQ and with other server admins and staff
                through their TCN representatives.

            <ITitle e="h3" icon="public" text="Global Channels" />
            <p>
                You will have access to global channels, which are channels where messages are
                relayed to all connected servers. We have a public global channel so your members
                can talk to members all across the TCN from the comfort of your server, as well as
                channels for staff. You will also be able to use these channels for collaboration
                events if you want participating servers' members to be able to talk to each other
                from any server.

            <p>
                You gain access to TCN Banshares, which are a system we have that lets you receive
                or automatically ban problematic users ahead of time so you don't have to deal with
                them the hard way. All of our banshares are manually reviewed by our observers. See
                the <a href="/info/banshares">banshare info page</a> for more information.

            <p>
                We prioritize two-way communication with our member servers. We are always open to
                feedback and will reach out for opportunities to improve the network to work for our
                members, and not the other way around.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <ITitle e="h3" icon="how_to_vote" text="Democracy" />
            <p>
                In addition to communicating major changes with our members clearly, we propose
                these changes and vote on major decisions on them, and the observer team does not
                have any more of a say in matters than everyone else. Each server gets one vote in
                all important matters. We also implement follow-up changes based on feedback.
            </p>

            <ITitle e="h3" icon="group" text="Collaboration" />
            <p>
                We don't expect everyone in the TCN to like everyone else, but even when discussions
                are heated we treat each other with civility and get to the core of the issue and
                come to a resolution that can benefit us all as much as possible. Additionally, we
                learn from conflicts, and every mistake or dispute is an opportunity to not just fix
                the root of the issue but improve other parts of the network.

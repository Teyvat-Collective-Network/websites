            <Linkable id="process" e="h2" value="The Process" />
            <p>
                Observation is the period of time during which one of our observers will oversee all
                operations in the server, requiring view permissions to all channels and the audit
                logs. Throughout the process, they will also facilitate communication between your
                server and the network, including passing on concerns about your server but also
                forwarding questions you may have along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of observation, the observer will create a report evaluating your
                server's environment and staff organization and performance, which will be shared to
                you for feedback. Afterwards, a vote will be held to induct your server into the
                TCN.
            </p>
            <p>
                At any point, you may choose to cancel observation which means your server will not
                be inducted into the TCN and you may remove the observer's permissions.
            </p>
            <Linkable
                id="why-access"
                e="h2"
                value="Why does the observer need access to everything?"
            />
            <p>
                The observer's duty is to provide the council with all of the information necessary
                to make an informed decision on whether or not your server is fit for the TCN and
                vice versa. Being able to evaluate everything that happens in your server is crucial
                to this process. Audit log access is needed to be able to corroborate actions your
                staff take.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may discuss some matters internally as an observer team, but nothing will be
                shared with the rest of the network until you review the report, so you don't have
                to worry about the observer spying on your server and sharing information without
                your permission with the network.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there is information that we believe is crucial to the result and will not leave
                out, you may at any point withdraw your application and we will not publish any
                report or share the information.
            </p>

                id="what-to-do-when-rejected"

            <p>
                You may re-apply after 3 weeks, unless we have specifically informed you that we
                will not reconsider in the future. If you re-apply, we expect you to have addressed
                all reasons that were brought up leading to your rejection/denial.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we did not give you any reasons, there are probably private reasons usually
                involving serious concerns with the owner or prominent admins that we believe make
                your server irredeemable, in which case it is unlikely we will reconsider.
            </p>
            <Linkable
                id="requesting-different-observer"
                e="h2"
                value="Can I request a different observer?"
            />
            <p>
                We will avoid assigning observers that have personal ties, either positive or
                negative, with you or your staff. However, if you have personal issues with the
                observer that was assigned, you may reach out to another observer to request someone
                else to be selected.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there are no options that we are willing or able to assign to you that you are
                okay with, we may have to either postpone until the observer committee changes or
                other observers are available, or we may have to agree to cancel, at least until a
                later date.
            </p>
            <p>
                If at any point throughout the process you believe the observer is being
                problematic, you may wish to report them to another observer and we will discuss how
                to proceed from there (usually, we can just transfer the observation to someone else
                without causing you any delays, and we may relieve the observer of their duty if we
                find it is necessary).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you believe you are not being fairly represented in the report, you may discuss
                that with them and propose changes, but they do not have to follow all of your
                requests and are required to present all necessary information for the council to
                make an informed decision. If you believe any misinformation was presented or the
                facts are misconstrued in a way to make your server look bad, you may provide
                evidence to another observer to have the matter privately discussed.

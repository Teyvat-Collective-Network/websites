        <p>
            The TCN does not enforce any particular structure on its member servers. TCN servers are
            not required to change their server setup, follow a template, enforce particular rules,
            or give any permissions to TCN observers. Our only requirements are to display a list of
            TCN partner servers, cross-post event promotions from partner servers, and maintain a
            healthy community that follows its rules.
        </p>
        <p>The TCN is divided into three components. Click a card to learn more.</p>

                    These are the individual servers of the TCN, each a mains server dedicated to a
                    specific character.

                    and other server staff and ask questions or give feedback about the TCN.

                    This is the headquarters server for the TCN. It is private to the TCN council,
                    which consists of each server's owner and up to one other trusted member. This
                    server facilitates communication and coordination of servers.

                    As a member server of the TCN, you get access to information on members, ongoing
                    issues, as well as informative resources like server setup and tools and
                    on-demand help for the technical aspects and community and staff management.

                    TCN servers have quick and easy access to communication with each other. In
                    addition to being able to more quickly resolve any issues and form strong
                    relationships with many other prominent servers, you have the unique opportunity
                    to more easily start collaborations for things like events, which you can also
                    promote through the TCNâ€™s event announcement feed.

                    When you join the TCN, you automatically become a TCN partner of over 40 servers
                    and will have your server listed on the partner list in all of them.
                    Additionally, you will be able to get tips on how to improve your server
                    environment and grow a strong, healthy community.

                    We prioritize two-way communication with our member servers. We are always open
                    to feedback and will reach out for opportunities to improve the network to work
                    for our members, and not the other way around.

                <p>
                    In addition to communicating major changes with our members clearly, we propose
                    these changes and vote on major decisions on them, and the observer team does
                    not have any more of a say in matters than everyone else. Each server gets one
                    vote in all important matters. We also implement follow-up changes based on
                    feedback.

                    We don't expect everyone in the TCN to like everyone else, but even when
                    discussions are heated we treat each other with civility and get to the core of
                    the issue and come to a resolution that can benefit us all as much as possible.
                    Additionally, we learn from conflicts, and every mistake or dispute is an
                    opportunity to not just fix the root of the issue but improve other parts of the
                    network.

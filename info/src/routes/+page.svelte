                We are a network of over 40 high-quality Genshin Impact Discord servers, each
                dedicated to a character from the game.

                The mission of the TCN is to unite all mains servers across Teyvat and provide
                support and promote collaboration between partners.

                The TCN does not enforce any particular structure on its member servers. TCN servers
                are not required to change their server setup, follow a template, enforce particular
                rules, or give any permissions to TCN observers. Our only requirements are to
                display a list of TCN partner servers and cross-post event promotions from partner
                servers.

                        council, which consists of each server's owner and up to one other trusted
                        member. This server facilitates communication and coordination of servers.

                        As a member server of the TCN, you get access to information on members,
                        ongoing issues, as well as informative resources like server setup and tools

                        TCN servers have quick and easy access to communication with each other. In
                        addition to being able to more quickly resolve any issues and form strong
                        relationships with many other prominent servers, you have the unique
                        opportunity to more easily start collaborations for things like events,
                        which you can also promote through the TCNâ€™s event announcement feed.

                        When you join the TCN, you automatically become a TCN partner of over 40
                        servers and will have your server listed on the partner list in all of them.
                        Additionally, you will be able to get tips on how to improve your server
                        environment and grow a strong, healthy community.

                        We prioritize two-way communication with our member servers. We are always
                        open to feedback and will reach out for opportunities to improve the network
                        to work for our members, and not the other way around.

                        In addition to communicating major changes with our members clearly, we
                        propose these changes and vote on major decisions on them, and the observer
                        team does not have any more of a say in matters than everyone else. Each
                        server gets one vote in all important matters. We also implement follow-up
                        changes based on feedback.

                        We don't expect everyone in the TCN to like everyone else, but even when
                        discussions are heated we treat each other with civility and get to the core
                        of the issue and come to a resolution that can benefit us all as much as
                        possible. Additionally, we learn from conflicts, and every mistake or
                        dispute is an opportunity to not just fix the root of the issue but improve
                        other parts of the network.
